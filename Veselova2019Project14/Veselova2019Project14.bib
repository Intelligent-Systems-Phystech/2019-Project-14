  abstract = {Brain activity can be used as a control signal for brain-machine interfaces (BMIs). A powerful and widely acknowledged BMI approach, so far only applied in invasive recording techniques, uses neuronal signals related to limb movements for equivalent, multidimensional control of an external effector. Here, we investigated whether this approach is also applicable for noninvasive recording techniques. To this end, we recorded whole-head MEG during center-out movements with the hand and found significant power modulation of MEG activity between rest and movement in three frequency bands: an increase for < or = 7 Hz (low-frequency band) and 62-87 Hz (high-gamma band) and a decrease for 10-30 Hz (beta band) during movement. Movement directions could be inferred on a single-trial basis from the low-pass filtered MEG activity as well as from power modulations in the low-frequency band, but not from the beta and high-gamma bands. Using sensors above the motor area, we obtained a surprisingly high decoding accuracy of 67% on average across subjects. Decoding accuracy started to rise significantly above chance level before movement onset. Based on simultaneous MEG and EEG recordings, we show that the inference of movement direction works equally well for both recording techniques. In summary, our results show that neuronal activity associated with different movements of the same effector can be distinguished by means of noninvasive recordings and might, thus, be used to drive a noninvasive BMI.},

  abstract = {In this paper a tensor-based approach is developed for calibration of binary self-paced
brain–computer interface (BCI) systems. In order to form the feature tensor,
electrocorticograms, recorded during behavioral experiments in freely moving animals (rats),
were mapped to the spatial–temporal–frequency space using the continuous wavelet
transformation. An N-way partial least squares (NPLS) method is applied for tensor
factorization and the prediction of a movement intention depending on neuronal activity. To
cope with the huge feature tensor dimension, an iterative NPLS (INPLS) algorithm is
proposed. Computational experiments demonstrated the good accuracy and robustness of
INPLS. The algorithm does not depend on any prior neurophysiological knowledge and allows
fully automatic system calibration and extraction of the BCI-related features. Based on the
analysis of time intervals preceding the BCI events, the calibration procedure constructs a
predictive model of control. The BCI system was validated by experiments in freely moving
animals under conditions close to those in a natural environment.},

  abstract = {Dynamic systems have proven to be well suited to describe a broad spectrum of human coordination behavior such as synchronization with auditory stimuli. Simultaneous measurements of the spatiotemporal dynamics of electroencephalographic (EEG) and magnetoencephalographic (MEG) data reveals that the dynamics of the brain signals is highly ordered and also accessible by dynamic systems theory. However, models of EEG and MEG dynamics have typically been formulated only in terms of phenomenological modeling such as fixed-current dipoles or spatial EEG and MEG patterns. In this paper, it is our goal to connect three levels of organization, that is the level of coordination behavior, the level of patterns observed in the EEG and MEG and the level of neuronal network dynamics. To do so, we develop a methodological framework, which defines the spatiotemporal dynamics of neural ensembles, the neural field, on a sphere in three dimensions. Using magnetic resonance imaging we map the neural field dynamics from the sphere onto the folded cortical surface of a hemisphere. The neural field represents the current flow perpendicular to the cortex and, thus, allows for the calculation of the electric potentials on the surface of the skull and the magnetic fields outside the skull to be measured by EEG and MEG, respectively. For demonstration of the dynamics, we present the propagation of activation at a single cortical site resulting from a transient input. Finally, a mapping between finger movement profile and EEG/MEG patterns is obtained using Volterra integrals.},

Because the patient was available for only 3 days, the goal was to demonstrate the possibility of a patient gaining control over the motor imagery-based Graz BCI system within a very short training period. By applying himself to an organized and coordinated training procedure, the patient was able to generate distinctive EEG-patterns by the imagination of movements of his paralyzed left hand. These patterns consisted of power decreases in specific frequency bands that could be classified by the BCI. The output signal of the BCI emulated the shoulder joystick usually used, and by consecutive imaginations the patient was able to switch between different grasp phases of the lateral grasp that the Freehand® system provided. By performing a part of the grasp-release test, the patient was able to move a simple object from one place to another. The results presented in this work give evidence that Brain–Computer Interfaces are an option for the control of neuroprostheses in patients with high spinal cord lesions. The fact that the user learned to control the BCI in a comparatively short time indicates that this method may also be an alternative approach for clinical purposes.}

A neural interface system could restore mobility and independence for people with paralysis by translating neuronal activity directly into control signals for assistive devices. We have previously shown that people with long-standing tetraplegia can use a neural interface system to move and click a computer cursor and to control physical devices. Able-bodied monkeys have used a neural interface system to control a robotic arm9, but it is unknown whether people with profound upper extremity paralysis or limb loss could use cortical neuronal ensemble signals to direct useful arm actions. Here we demonstrate the ability of two people with long-standing tetraplegia to use neural interface system-based control of a robotic arm to perform three-dimensional reach and grasp movements. Participants controlled the arm and hand over a broad space without explicit training, using signals decoded from a small, local population of motor cortex (MI) neurons recorded from a 96-channel microelectrode array. One of the study participants, implanted with the sensor 5 years earlier, also used a robotic arm to drink coffee from a bottle. Although robotic reach and grasp actions were not as fast or accurate as those of an able-bodied person, our results demonstrate the feasibility for people with tetraplegia, years after injury to the central nervous system, to recreate useful multidimensional control of complex devices directly from a small sample of neural signals.},

The immediate goal of BCI research is to provide communications capabilities to severely disabled people who are totally paralyzed or ‘locked in’ by neurological neuromuscular disorders, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, brain stem stroke, or spinal cord injury. Here, we review the state-of-the-art of BCIs, looking at the different steps that form a standard BCI: signal acquisition, preprocessing or signal enhancement, feature extraction, classification and the control interface. We discuss their advantages, drawbacks, and latest advances, and we survey the numerous technologies reported in the scientific literature to design each step of a BCI. First, the review examines the neuroimaging modalities used in the signal acquisition step, each of which monitors a different functional brain activity such as electrical, magnetic or metabolic activity. Second, the review discusses different electrophysiological control signals that determine user intentions, which can be detected in brain activity. Third, the review includes some techniques used in the signal enhancement step to deal with the artifacts in the control signals and improve the performance. Fourth, the review studies some mathematic algorithms used in the feature extraction and classification steps which translate the information in the control signals into commands that operate a computer or other device.

abstract={The spatial statistics of scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) are usually presented as coherence in individual frequency bands. These coherences result both from correlations among neocortical sources and volume conduction through the tissues of the head. The scalp EEG is spatially low-pass filtered by the poorly conducting skull, introducing artificial correlation between the electrodes. A four concentric spheres (brain, CSF, skull, and scalp) model of the head and stochastic field theory are used here to derive an analytic estimate of the coherence at scalp electrodes due to volume conduction of uncorrelated source activity, predicting that electrodes within 10-12 cm can appear correlated. The surface Laplacian estimate of cortical surface potentials spatially bandpass filters the scalp potentials reducing this artificial coherence due to volume conduction. Examination of EEG data confirms that the coherence estimates from raw scalp potentials and Laplacians are sensitive to different spatial bandwidths and should be used in parallel in studies of neocortical dynamic function.},

Both methods have disadvantages: EEG has limited resolution and requires extensive training, while single-neuron recording entails significant clinical risks and has limited stability. We demonstrate here for the first time that electrocorticographic (ECoG) activity recorded from the surface of the brain can enable users to control a one-dimensional computer cursor rapidly and accurately. We first identified ECoG signals that were associated with different types of motor and speech imagery. Over brief training periods of 3–24 min, four patients then used these signals to master closed-loop control and to achieve success rates of 74–100\% in a one-dimensional binary task. In additional open-loop experiments, we found that ECoG signals at frequencies up to 180 Hz encoded substantial information about the direction of two-dimensional joystick movements. Our results suggest that an ECoG-based BCI could provide for people with severe motor disabilities a non-muscular communication and control option that is more powerful than EEG-based BCIs and is potentially more stable and less traumatic than BCIs that use electrodes penetrating the brain.}

  abstract={The goal of this element of the competition is to predict the flexion of individual fingers from
signals recorded from the surface of the brain (electrocorticography (ECoG)). This data set contains
brain signals from three subjects, as well as the time courses of the flexion of each of five fingers.
The task in this competition is to use the provided flexion information in order to predict finger
flexion for a provided test set. The performance of the classifier will be evaluated by calculating the
average correlation coefficient r between actual and predicted finger flexion.}

  abstract={Objective . Intracortical brain–machine interfaces (BMIs) are a promising source of prosthesis control signals for individuals with severe motor disabilities. Previous BMI studies have primarily focused on predicting and controlling whole-arm movements; precise control of hand kinematics, however, has not been fully demonstrated. Here, we investigate the continuous decoding of precise finger movements in rhesus macaques. Approach . In order to elicit precise and repeatable finger movements, we have developed a novel behavioral task paradigm which requires the subject to acquire virtual fingertip position targets. In the physical control condition, four rhesus macaques performed this task by moving all four fingers together in order to acquire a single target. This movement was equivalent to controlling the aperture of a power grasp. During this task performance, we recorded neural spikes from intracortical electrode arrays in primary motor cortex. Main results . Using a standard Kalman filter, we could reconstruct continuous finger movement offline with an average correlation of ρ   =  0.78 between actual and predicted position across four rhesus macaques. For two of the monkeys, this movement prediction was performed in real-time to enable direct brain control of the virtual hand. Compared to physical control, neural control performance was slightly degraded; however, the monkeys were still able to successfully perform the task with an average target acquisition rate of 83.1%. The monkeys’ ability to arbitrarily specify fingertip position was also quantified using an information throughput metric. During brain control task performance, the monkeys achieved an average 1.01 bits s −1 throughput, similar to that achieved in previous studies which decoded upper-arm movements to control computer cursors using a standard Kalman filter. Significance . This is, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of brain control of finger-level fine motor skills. We believe that these results represent an important step towards full and dexterous control of neural prosthetic devices.}

abstract={Classification of finger movements from brain signals is an important problem in emerging neural prosthetics research. Current techniques have focused primarily on aggregating data from different brain sites independently, without regard to the interaction between different brain sites. We performed a very simple experiment classifying finger movements during electrocorticographic recording from motor cortex. Unlike previous experiments of this type, we examined whether the most-simple type of instantaneous interactions between brain regions could improve classification. We focused on two simple, but salient markers: phase coherence of the 12-20 Hz beta range, and simple correlation in broadband spectral change. We compared behavioral classification using these interactions with simple amplitude changes in beta and broadband magnitude. We found that inter-electrode phase coherence and cross-correlation, were relatively poor at distinguishing between finger movements, and only mediocre at identifying null/rest periods.},

abstract={Autoregressive (AR) spectral estimation is a popular method for modeling the electroencephalogram (EEG), and therefore the frequency domain EEG phenomena that are used for control of a brain-computer interface (BCI). Several studies have been conducted to evaluate the optimal AR model order for EEG, but the criteria used in these studies does not necessarily equate to the optimal AR model order for sensorimotor rhythm (SMR)-based BCI control applications. The present study confirms this by evaluating the EEG spectra of data obtained during control of SMR-BCI using different AR model orders and model evaluation criteria. The results indicate that the AR model order that optimizes SMR-BCI control performance is generally higher than the model orders that are frequently used in SMR-BCI studies},

abstract = "The paper addresses the problem of designing Brain-Computer Interfaces. It investigates feature selection methods in regression, applied to ECoG-based motion decoding. The problem is to predict hand trajectories from the voltage time series of cortical activity. A special characteristic of this problem is the inherently multi-way structure of feature description. The feature description resides in spatial-spectra-temporal domain and includes the voltage time series and their spectral representation. Since electrocorticographic data is highly correlated in temporal, spectral and spatial domains, redundancy of the feature space as well as its dimensionality become a major obstacle for robust solution of the regression problem both in multi-way and flat cases. Feature selection reduces dimensionality and increases model robustness. It plays the crucial role in obtaining adequate predictions. The main contribution of this paper is the following. We propose a filtering feature selection for multi-way data. The proposed method extends quadratic programming feature selection (QPFS) approach. QPFS selects a subset of features by solving a quadratic problem. It incorporates estimates of similarity between features and their relevance to the regression problem. QPFS offers an effective way to leverage similarities between features and their importance. Our modification allows to apply QPFS to multi-way data. By taking the multi-way structure of features into account, the proposed modification reduces computational costs of optimization problem in QPFS. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that the proposed modification improves prediction quality of resultant models. The proposed method is model-free and provides interpretable results, which makes it relevant for knowledge extraction and domain analysis."

abstract={This article presents the method that won the brain-computer interface (BCI) competition IV addressed to the prediction of the finger flexion from electrocorticogram (ECoG) signals. ECoG-based BCIs have recently drawn the attention from the community. Indeed, ECoG can provide higher spatial resolution and better signal quality than classical EEG recordings. It is also more suitable for long-term use. These characteristics allow to decode precise brain activities and to realize efficient ECoG-based neuroprostheses. Signal processing is a very important task in BCIs research for translating brain signals into commands. Here, we present a linear regression method based on the amplitude modulation of band-specific ECoG including a short-term memory for individual finger flexion prediction. The effectiveness of the method was proven by achieving the highest value of correlation coefficient between the predicted and recorded finger flexion values on data set 4 during the BCI competition IV.}
